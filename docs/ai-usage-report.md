# AI Usage Report — Assignment 4
This project used AI tools to support development, improve UI design, and assist with debugging. All code was reviewed, modified, and fully understood before being included.

## Tools Used
- **ChatGPT**: Helped with debugging JavaScript, improving CSS animations, designing UI elements, and generating documentation.
- **GitHub Copilot**: Assisted with small code suggestions and repetitive patterns.

## How AI Was Used
- Created Mario-style UI ideas (buttons, skill blocks, animations).
- Helped fix issues like missing images, sound effects, and script errors.
- Improved readability and structure of `script.js`.
- Assisted with writing README and this AI usage report.
- Suggested better project filtering logic and design patterns.

## My Contributions
- I rewrote and customized all AI-generated code.
- I designed the final layout, added new skills, added ReFocus project, and structured the entire site.
- I integrated sounds, animations, filters, and GitHub API myself.
- All styling decisions were adjusted manually to match my theme.

## Learning Outcome
Using AI helped me:
- Debug faster  
- Understand JavaScript DOM logic better  
- Improve UI/UX design  
- Write cleaner, more organized code  

AI was used responsibly as a learning tool, not as a replacement for my own work.
